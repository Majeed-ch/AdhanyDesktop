## Known Limitations

- **Internet Connectivity**: The application requires an internet connection at least once a day to update prayer times.
- **Limited Country Support**: Currently, the application only supports two countries, Canada and Saudi Arabia, and is available in English only.

## Future Development

I have plans to enhance the Adhan Time Notifier with the following features:

- **Additional Adhan Sounds**: I will add more Adhan sounds, allowing users to select their preferred sound.
- **Arabic Language Support**: I aim to include support for the Arabic language to cater to a broader audience.
- **Reduced Internet Dependency**: I plan to minimize the reliance on internet connectivity, limiting its requirement to only when saving new settings.
